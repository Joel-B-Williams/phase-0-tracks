 - Linux Design Philosophy - 
 The great (and possibly nonexistant) Doug Gwyn is quoted as saying "Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things."
 Linux, as an OS, assumes that the user knows what s/he is doing, and allows it to happen.

 - VPS's and You -
 Virtual Private Servers are Virtual Machines sold as a service, and hosted by whoever you handed the money to.  They can be set up fairly simply, especially if you skip a lot of steps.  They are a fully functional virtual computer that can then be accessed through your own machine (using your keyboard/screen to interact with the virtual hard drive/etc).
 Particularly useful as a "safe place" to experiment (you can set one up just to watch it burn, 666, anarchy in the UK), or can be fully sustained large 'machines' used to run hardcore projects.
 Another bonus, it's a universal storage space (sort of... can be).  If you set it up to be so, it's accessible from any computer/phone/whatever-with-an-internet connection.

 - Root, and the power of the ancients -
 Running things as root can be particularly dangerous, even in the "play with fire and learn what happens" world of Linux.  If you're a given User, you can burn down that whole User's everything... but if you burn down Root, you just roasted *everything*.  Granted even then you can reinstall for free, but you lost all your junk that may or may not be important.
 If you get to looking at malware, if it gets into Root then it has access/control everywhere, not just a given user's area (unless it's designed to get to root from somewhere else, or other magic hackery deception).
