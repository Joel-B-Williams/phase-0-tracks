- Common HTTP status codes -
200 = successful response
404 Not Found = Christmas is cancelled, no puppies were adopted, and whatever you were searching for wasn't there (probably you looked in the wrong place)
403 FORBIDDEN = You have been cut off, there will be no extra porridge, and generally you do not have access to whatever is behind that internet-wall
500 Internal Server Error = Genric 'something went wrong server-side'
503 Service Unavailable = For some reason, the server is unavailable.  Why?  MYSTERY OF LIFE.
504 Gateway Timeout = Something took too long, and it quit.  Much like me trying to go to the gym.

- GET vs. POST -
A GET command is requesting information from a resource (similar to SQLite SELECT).
A POST command is submitting data to be processed (more along the lines of an INSERT)

- Cookies -
Typically small pieces of information that a server stores on your local space for later access.  Often used to store log-in names/passwords, can also be used for keeping track of your history if you're "less than careful".  Storing them on your local machine helps mitigate privacy concerns while allowing users ease of access.
