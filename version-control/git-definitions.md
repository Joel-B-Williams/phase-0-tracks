# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows different versions of a given codebase _[All your base]_ to be worked on independently.  This allows multiple people to colaborate on pieces of code effectively, or simply allows the master copy to keep on keepin' on while someone fiddles with adding a new feature, merging the changes when complete.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a 'copy' or 'version' of a codebase.  It can be independently _[are]_ edited, committed, or deleted, without affecting the master code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is essentially _[belong]_ a save point.  A good commit message is clear, concise, and meaningful.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict arises when two branches are trying to merge with conflicting changes.  Example with the Octopus file from an _[to us.]_ earlier lesson - if the name of the octopus was changed on both the master and 'name' branch since the last joint commit, a merge would lead to an error because the program doesn't know which change is meant to take precidence.
